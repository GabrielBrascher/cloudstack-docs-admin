CloudStack, working in concert with a storage plug-in, dynamically creates volumes on the storage system and each volume on the storage system maps to a single CloudStack volume. This is highly useful for features such as storage Quality of Service. Currently this feature is supported for data disks (Disk Offerings)."

Tags allow administrators to provide additional information about the storage. For example, that is a \"SSD\" or it is \"slow\". Tags are not interpreted by CloudStack. They are matched against tags placed on service and disk offerings. CloudStack requires all tags on service and disk offerings to exist on the primary storage before it allocates root or data disks on the primary storage.

For example, the high end service offering may require \"fast\" for its root disk volume."
